# For this exercise:
# The challenge here is to write a mysum function that does the same thing as the
# built-in sum function. However, instead of taking a single sequence as a parameter, it
# should take a variable number of arguments. Thus, although you might invoke
# sum([1,2,3]), youâ€™d instead invoke mysum(1,2,3) or mysum(10,20,30,40,50).

def mysum(*numbers):

    sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        sum += num
    print(sum)
    
mysum(1, 2, 3, 4)
